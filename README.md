### WELCOME TO MY PUBLIC REPO ###

I'm just an administrator doing administratory things with some pretty neat master's programs in engineering fields. Check out my site [here](maseng.ucsd.edu)

I've got:

### Data Science & Engineering
(it's got something to do with data - that's all I know so far...)
### Wireless Embedded Systems 
(think IoT and embedded sensors engineering - make your Roomba become a true DJ Roomba)
### Architecture-based Enterprise Systems Engineering 
(It's not an architecture program - it's a systems thinking/engineering + MBA hybrid program)
### Medical Device Engineering 
(Have you ever wanted to build a wheelchair with rockets? You totes should...)
